Jimmy Page: ""They don't cheer too madly there, you know? We were really scared, because we only had about fifteen hours to practice together. It was sort of an experimental concert to see if we were any good. I guess."" (Dec. 1968 interview)
Peter Grant: ""Oh, I remember everything about that first show in Copenhagen. I remember everything Jimmy Page had told me about the drummer, Bonzo. And the whole performance. It was so… exciting! Just to be part of it was fantastic. There was never a thought of, God, this is going to sell X amount of records. I thought it could be the best band ever.""
On September 7th 2013, marking the 45th anniversary of Led Zeppelin's first gig, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the school in Gladsaxe where it all began.
Review: In Teen Club Nyt (Gladsaxe Teen Club's monthly members' magazine) in October 1968, Bent Larsen (who was the magazine's normal reviewer) gave this rave review of the new Yardbirds first concert: ""The English group YARDBIRDS had been rehearsing their new set most of the afternoon. So when they entered the scene they were really hot to get started and give it all. Their performance and their music were absolutely flawless, and the music continued to ring nicely in the ears for some time after the curtains were drawn after their show. Let me in particular give my praise to JIMMY PAGE who has made a great job with the 3 new men. They really succeeded and in particular the guitar solo by Jimmy Page created huge applause. We can therefore conclude that the new YARDBIRDS are at least as good as the old ones were."" [teenclubs.dk]"

Press Review:  ""Jimmy Page has put a new band together. The music is the same, only better than ever... Robert Plant should face some small criticism and a lot of praise for an excellent performance. There is no doubt that he is a good singer, but he doesn't have to twist his body like he's having a ruptured appendix, does he? Musically, the band is super-great. Their hard disciplined beat is amazing. Of course, it was foremost Jimmy Page that was responsible for this but the drummer should also be mentioned; a drum solo so wild and good is hard to find. It was so good that one almost wished that John Bonham wouldn't stop.""

Press: Fan recalls Led Zeppelin gig at Newcastle Mayfair
A NORTH music fan has lifted the lid on the night Led Zeppelin played their first ever gig in Newcastle.
Billed as one of the greatest rock bands of all time, Led Zeppelin went on to sell millions of albums worldwide and conquer American stadiums in the late 1960s and 1970s.
But it’s a little known fact that the four-piece started their gigging life on stage at the now defunct Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle in October, 1968.
As the 44th anniversary of this historic gig passed, North East musician John Woods shared his memories of the night the then relatively unknown band performed together as a foursome for the very first time.
The 68-year-old, whose band Junco Partners supported Led Zeppelin that very night, said: “It’s a long time ago but I remember being asked by the Mayfair promoter to play, supporting them with a couple of other local bands but I didn’t really know much about them.
“I had heard of Robert Plant and Jimmy Page but didn’t really know much about the band.”
It was Jimmy Page’s band the Yardbirds that had originally been booked to play the venue on October 4, 1968 but they had since split.
Page wanted to honour all the pre-booked gigs so he saw it as an opportunity to introduce his new band which was made up of drummer John Bonham, bassist John Paul Jones, Page on guitar and singer Robert Plant
Initially going under the name the New Yardbirds, the hundreds of gig-goers who squeezed into the Mayfair that night were unaware that history was in the making.
“They came on the night and we shared a dressing room back stage with them and they were a good bunch,” said John.
“They weren’t as mad as they came to be but a couple of them were a bit bonkers. Jimmy Page, in particular, definitely seemed a bit bonkers.”
The Junco Partners took to the stage before the New Yardbirds to warm up the crowd before joining the audience to watch the newly-formed band.
John, of Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, said: “We all watched John Bonham on the drums and just remember thinking what a killer drummer he was.
“He had so much power and feel. If a drummer has got the feel it makes the band 20 times better.
“For a four-piece they were loud as hell which is what I like.
“They played all their songs well and they wrote their own material, it all seemed to be going well for them.”
He added: “Playing with a band like that I thought ‘these guys know what it’s all about’.
“It was a good crowd but it wasn’t full because they didn’t have the name at that stage.
“But within one or two years Led Zeppelin were big business.
“After the gig we just sort of put them on the mental back-burner in our heads but when I saw they had done so well I was really chuffed because that’s the sort of story you can tell to your mates.”
John, who owns Flip Vintage in Newcastle City Centre, says he still looks back on the night with fond memories and counts himself lucky to have been involved in the now monumental night.
“Looking back now I think we did watch them and appreciate what they did and, even though Robert Plant was a little vain, he was a great singer,” remembered John.
l In 2007, 20 million rock fans applied online for 18,000 tickets to Led Zeppelin’s one-off reunion at the O2 Arena, London. Now, five years on, that concert will be finally released on the DVD, Celebration Day, next month.

  Led Zeppelin's first gig - Newcastle Mayfair - 4th October 1968
by Hazel Plater and Ian Ravendale
I'm very proud that this story, written by Ian Ravendale (real name Ian Penman, but he writes articles under this name to avoid confusion with former NME writer Ian Penman), has appeared in Classic Rock magazine this month thanks to input from the North East Music History Facebook group.  Turns out Led Zeppelin's first gig was at Newcastle's Mayfair - 4th October 1968 - a fact hitherto unreported.  The article tells the full story and includes first hand accounts from NEMH group members Ray Laidlaw and Charlie Foskett, a late-friend's tale told by John Porteous and additional research by Marshall Hall.  Well done everyone concerned - Led Zeppelin history, North East Music History and a fine story unveiled!  The magazine is available from all good newsagents or by subscription from http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/
Led Zeppelin's first gig featured in Classic Rock magazine October 2012
After I posted the above article, Ian himself got in touch with me, to elaborate on how the Classic Rock story happened:
""The legendary Led Zeppelin played their first handful of UK gigs under the name The New Yardbirds, a roll-over from leader Jimmy Page's former band whose final gig obligations they were honouring.  The first of these shows was at Newcastle Mayfair ballroom on 4 October 1968 with support slots from local bands Downtown Faction and The Junco Partners plus New York Public Library, originally from Leeds but based in London by this time. I'd found out about the show while researching another possible locally based Led Zeppelin story.  The fact that Zep made their UK debut on Tyneside and under a different name jumped out to me as a potentially fascinating subject for an article and Classic Rock agreed.
Still being billed as The Yardbirds, on the night they were billed as The New Yardbirds
If anything was going to stretch my super-researcher powers it was locating the support bands, audience members, promoter and Mayfair staff and then getting some good stories and anecdotes out of them.  The gig was, after all, 44 years ago!  But, pulling in favours and with the invaluable help of a notice on the main NEMH site, I got the response I needed from people who were at a gig that was, by most accounts, not very well attended.
In addition to interviewing Ray Laidlaw (Downtown Faction) and Junco Partners Bob Sargeant and Charlie Harcourt I also spoke to promoter Fraser Suffield and Brian Greenaway who was the manager of the Mayfair in 1968 that I located via a lead from Marshall Hall.  Brian was seriously ill when I went up to chat with him in hospital in Berwick.  He was courteous and responsive and I appreciated him seeing me under very adverse circumstances. Sadly Brian died a couple of days ago.
Some people, like NEMH member Charlie Foskett, had great recall of the event-remarkable because no-one knew, of course, that they were witnessing the first UK gig of the outfit who would become the world's biggest rock band in the 1970’s.  Others remembered less but I still unearthed lots of great information that has never seen print before.
I got off to a bit of a false start by spending a fair amount of time trying to track down Terry Reid, who was credited on the advance tickets as the main support act.
Terry rang me and told me that, no, his band Fanasia didn’t play the gig because they were off supporting Cream on their Farewell US tour!
This was why, I surmised, New York Public Library were credited on the Evening Chronicle adverts, which would, of course, have gone to press a lot later than the advance tickets.  They’d have been the replacement for Reid.  It took a bit of scurrying around (with the deadline looming!) but I managed to get hold of a couple of guys from the band.  One was convinced that the gig took place in Glasgow, but I quickly managed to disprove that to him.  The other, Tez Stokes, NYPL’s guitarist, was a very good interviewee with a good memory of the event, enhanced by him already slightly knowing John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page.
I was pretty happy with the finished article and the reaction to it.
This is exactly the sort of article I like doing where I can locate people and untold information to tell a story that has previously gone unrelated.  Zeppelin have been discussed, debated and written about non-stop since their split in 1980 following the death of John Bonham but very little exists about their first UK gig.  Until my article.  Thanks to Hazel and everybody else from NEMH who helped me do it.

Their contract for this gig, dated Sept. 13th,  billed them as ""Yardbirds"", where they would receive 50% of the gross ticket sales, ""less cost of support act: ₤15"". 11:30pm start time. Opening act: The Bakerloo Blues Line.
Jimmy Page (January 1969): ""The Marquee was fantastic - just great. We were totally knocked out when we came out of there. We thought they might have had it in for us because at the that date, we were still calling ourselves the Yardbirds - we hadn't thought of using Led Zeppelin yet.""
Ed Bicknell: “Peter couldn’t get anybody from the agency to go and see them. I was in London on my own so I went down to the Marquee and was astonished to see a queue right down Wardour Street and into Old Compton Street. There must have been 300 people standing in line. So I joined the end of the queue and eventually got in to see this gig. My memory was they didn’t play many songs. “Jimmy was banging away with the violin bow, so I guess they did ‘Dazed And Confused’ and they did a rock’n’roll medley at the end with some Little Richard and Elvis Presley numbers.""

New information sent in to LZ.com from the former Social Secretary of the college, (B. Clark), indicates this date took place on October 26, 1968. (This appearance is also listed as occurring on November 2, 1968). Possibly a leftover booking from the Yardbirds, they were billed as The ""New"" Yardbirds, paid £175 for 2 x 45 min spots. At the band's request, it was later changed to one longer set.
Clark: ""Marcus Bicknell was the booker - he’d also booked me RP and the Band of Joy earlier that year in March, as support to Herbie Goins. When the Yardbirds split, he offered me a choice of Keith Relf’s Renaissance or the as yet unnamed Jimmy Page band - I took Renaissance on the grounds they would sell more tickets - but they weren’t together in time so we switched to LZ instead. What a lucky break!"" (Dec. 2014)
Terry Page: ""At the time I had a band called The Junk Shop. We supported The New Yardbirds that night along with a band called The Gods."

The band earn £150 for this appearance which was sheduled for 2am (technically Nov. 10th). An office memo from Jimmy Page's personal collection states: ""Saturday 9th November 1968.

Jimmy Page (January 1969): ""(At the Roundhouse), we did alright. We only played a couple of dates in London - The Roundhouse and Marquee. The Marquee was fantastic - just great.

We thought they might have had it in for us because at the that date, we were still calling ourselves the Yardbirds - we hadn't thought of using Led Zeppelin yet.""
Rafael de Swarte from the support act, Tyres, comments on the gig:  “It was an exciting time, and just before Zeppelin headed to the States. John Lee Hooker was hanging around backstage watching. It was a good gig, except at one point the guitarist was left playing nothing – his lead had come out. We look around and John was peering around the curtain looking at us, with the lead curled around his foot! We never worked out if he was joking, clumsy or trying to get us to stop.”"

Review by concert attendee Stuart Penney: The first album was still four months away and I'm sure that some of the posters around town billed them as The New Yardbirds for this gig (only their 15th-ever show as it turned out). Jimmy Page was the only member I'd heard of but with a pedigree like his, the ten shillings (50p) entrance fee seemed like a worthwhile punt.

Review (1): Led Zeppelin, the re-grouped Yardbirds, made their Marquee debut last week. They are now very much a heavy music group, with singer Robert Plant leading and ably holding his own against a powerful backing trio of John Paul Jones (bass), John Bonham (drums), and Jimmy Page (guitar).
Amp troubles didn’t help them on this particular occasion but there seemed to be a tendency for too much volume which inevitably defeats musical definition.
One of the best numbers of the set was “Days of Confusion” (aka Dazed and Confused), featuring interesting inter-play of Plant’s voice and Page’s guitar on which he used a violin bow creating an unusual effect. Drummer Bonham is forceful, perhaps too much so, and generally there appears to be a need for Led Zeppelin to cut down on volume a bit. (T. Wilson, Melody Maker, Dec. 1968)
Press Review (2): Led Zeppelin may sound a pretty incongruous sort of name to Americans unfamiliar with the British sense of humor, but when Who drummer Keith Moon dreamed up the title for Jimmy Page’s new group he was recalling an ancient British saying. They say that when a joke falls flat, it “goes down like a lead Zeppelin” (named after the World War I airship), but Page’s new combo seems in little danger of flopping.
For their recent appearance at London’s Marquee Club, the ex-Yardbirds guitarist whipped his men into a commendable frenzy which was not without its moments of inspiration and extensive improvisation.
“Our music sort of resembles jazz, as far as the improvisation is concerned,” explained the leader. “All I can say is that we’re just sort of moving on and throwing ideas to each other.
“We usually have the beginning part worked out in advance and the ending, and we might have a couple of cues as to what the thing is going to go into, but we might go off into anything—who knows? We do have some numbers that are more or less the same from beginning to end but they’re mostly the shorter ones, and anyway, it’s more of a challenge to experiment.”
I thought they had a tendency to go on for too long and destroy effective climaxes by trying to top them with a further musical climax. Jimmy took this criticism kindly. “It’s funny you should say that, because when we played here at the Roundhouse, the reaction was so good that I asked people what they thought of the group. Nearly everyone I spoke to said ‘oh, it was great, but you could have done longer!’ It seems to be the scene now.”
His most impressive feat on the night I caught the group, was bowing his guitar strings in harmony with the vocal on a number called ‘Days of Confusion.’ (Dazed & Confused) Surprisingly, I discovered that he first tried out this feat more than three years ago. “With the voice we try to do a lot of answering phrases and so on and that usually builds up into quite a thing with the voice following behind,” Jimmy explained.

Billed as 'Yardbirds'.
Fan review: ""Having never managed to catch the Yardbirds in their Clapton or Beck days, I was excited when Bridge advertised a gig of theirs in Dec 68. The Country Club wasn't your typical venue, with everything focussed on the music; the band played in one of several rooms - quite small, probably about King Tuts sized. It wasn't full, far from it, maybe only about 30 of us. The only number I recall clearly, over that 49+ years, is Communication Breakdown.  The band got a very low-key reaction and when, at the end, Robert Plant said, ""Thank you and good night from Led Zeppelin"", I thought it was a reference to the unenthusiastic audience (remember, I thought I was watching the Yardbirds)"".
